First, we should try to figure out the whole story of the Animation.
than we should figure out how long we want it to be, how many frames we want.
Than i think we should make a base model of the world, like what goes where, than we use that to make story boards, we can work on the details of the models later in the process, just use place holder models of stuff.
(this is open to be edited if any one wants to add on to this!!)
